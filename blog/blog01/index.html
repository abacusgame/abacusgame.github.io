			<p>Current medical technology can make clones of creatures.
The clone becomes an Identical twin of the original one.
We can ask a surrogate mather to give birth to a clone baby.
Plants or single cell creatures propagate themselves with clones.
Graft technology is possible with plants.
There are Siamese twins.
If an old man make a clone of him and graft it on him, then they will be
Siamese twins. Or if we embed the clone into the the old man&rsquo;s body
like a pregnant woman, it will grow inside of his body.
Isn&rsquo;t it possible to use the clone as an internal or external processer
of blood or hormons or something ? I guess the internal environment of the
body will reach an equilibrium eventually, and then, the old man&rsquo;s disease
will be cured by the young ones youth and energy.
If the clone grows big, then the clone will be separated from the old man
and become a sibling of the man.
It&rsquo;s not the exact him, but if the clone learns everything of the old man,
then the clone can live on behalf of the man.
Or like a withered flower blossom again after it&rsquo;s grafted on a young plant,
can&rsquo;t human live long like plants ?
Probably even clones aren&rsquo;t needed I guess. Instead of clones, mammals make children. If the old one is grafted on a child, won&rsquo;t the old become rejuvinated
again? Siamese twins are the same ages, but I don&rsquo;t think there is a Siamese twin of a young one and an old one. It will be like a piggyback and cumbersome,
but the old one can possibly survive. Piggyback, I feel the light weight of my mom, and it makes me sad. A poet made a poem like that. I don&rsquo;t like to piggyback my mom, so please have your clone piggyback you.
When it comes to graft, a weak plant is usually grafted on a strong plant. So, maybe infant is too weak to be grafted on. If we can graft an old human on a gorilla&rsquo;s body, then they seem to become strong. Someday, it might possibly be realized.
In medical science, rats are used as models of human body.
I think I&rsquo;m also like a mere rat. I wish old people live long but they are
also like rats. Can human make a rat immortal and live long?
If we transplant an old brain into a young body, then does the old one become immortal ? We&rsquo;ll see the old man inside the body of new born clone baby. It will be like riding into a new vehicle.
Then we can talk again preserving the experience and knowledge of the old man.
If the clone sibblings are ethically problematic, then we can engineer the genetic code to make a headless one. The clone can be used as a backup or spair parts of the original one. If the spair isn&rsquo;t enough, we can graft the third clone on the original one as an external energy booster.
Incurable diseases or malignant diseases might be cured this way.
It will be just a problem of bio engineering. The genetic code is quadruple like binary code, so someday we can reverse engineer the code to generate a readable code.</p>
