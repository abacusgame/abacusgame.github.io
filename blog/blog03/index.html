			<p>My dad is suffeing from a disease called progressive supranuclear palsy: PSP.
Nowadays, I&rsquo;m caring my parent everyday.
Caring disabled is hassle. He is very heavy to support.
He can&rsquo;t keep his balance.
I need to control his balance when I try to make him walk.
He is almost bedridden. But I think that walking with his own foot is
quite important. To keep standing while feeling vertical stimulation
of gravity strengthen bones and stimulate the secretion of some
proper hormon, I guess. When a man become so weak that he cannot walk,
then that time will be the end of his life.
Once you becomme bedridden, you cannot walk again when you are old.
It is said that curing diseases is almost impossible even for doctors.
Prevention of diseases is crucial.
So I need to wrestle with him to make him walk everyday.
The progress of his disease is fast. and I think life is a thing
that must be most prioritised. I was given some money by working remotely,
but I wonder is this money worth risking his health without giving good care for him ?
In my youth, he took care of me as my dad, so I think this is a time for me to take care of him. I need to find a new job which I can work remotely.
I&rsquo;m already around fifty and I&rsquo;ve found that keeping up with the latest
technology is difficult for me. In IT field, it is said that people need to retire someday. In order to keep up with the latest technology, I need to read so many complicated documents and those documents become obsolete quickly.
Old books about old softwares are almost useless anymore and it&rsquo;s a waste of time to read them.
So I think I need to seek another career with which I can earn money for a long time.</p>
<p>Caregivers face such situation and there are lots of such carers.
Hopeless struggle against the disease. Dreary gloomy situation.
I&rsquo;m exhausted and feeling chronical fatigue.
Solution is needed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
