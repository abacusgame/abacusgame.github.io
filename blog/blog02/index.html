			<p>I&rsquo;ve worked as a delivery worker of Uber Eats and Demaekan.
I bought a bag below. When I bought it, it costs 4000 yen. But now
the price is increased. But perhaps you can find a web site that sells it
with 4000 yen.
The bag was useful but heavy. It can hold PET bottle to drink water with a net  beside it. It was a good point, but to tell the truth, I didn&rsquo;t use this bag
to put foods in it. I thought that the angle of my tolso seems unstable.
If I tilt my body, the angle of the bag will be changed, and the foods inside it
will become messy. I used a bycle to deliver foods, so I wanted to keep
even balance of the plates of the foods. So instead of using this bag, I put
foods inside a basket on the front of the bicycle. I layed folded bathtowel
to absorb shocks from bumpy roads. I used 2 cooler bags to put foods in them
to keep the temperature of foods and layed them on the folded bathtowel inside
the backet. In this way, you don&rsquo;t need to take off your delivery bag on your back
when you arrived at a customer&rsquo;s place. It&rsquo;s a bit hasle to take off your bag
and take out foods from the bag carefully and sholder it again to meet the customer. In my experience, no customer told me to use the delivery bag on my back. So you don&rsquo;t need to use this bag to tell the truth.</p>
