			<p>I&rsquo;ve finally got a vaccination against corona virus.</p>
<p>The effect was heavy. What I realized after getting the vaccination was</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve just underestimated the virus. During this pandemic, I went to</p>
<p>public places many times wearing masks. I thought that I was sturdy enough</p>
<p>to repel the virus. But after getting the vaccination, I had suffered from terrible symptoms of the vaccine. I felt killing chill. I spent night gasping all night sweating soggy in my bed. I know that the vaccine is detoxified or weakened than the real virus, but even such vaccine made me heavily sick. If I&rsquo;m infected with the real corona virus, I don&rsquo;t think I can survive. I understand why people in the TV die so easily with the corona virus. I&rsquo;ve understood that I&rsquo;m not strong enough than I thought. I think this pandemic is a serious crisis. I wonder if old people can survive this crisis. While they are alive, what can I do for them. The advancement of medicine is great. Medical doctors can make patients live long. They are not god, but their merciful deeds seem to me the act of god. I don&rsquo;t think I can develop CT scanner alone by myself. I&rsquo;m just leading a simple plain aimless life. The geniuses have invented such devices. Non intrusive inspection. That&rsquo;s not a single fluke, but they can do that repeatedly, and everyone in the world can be saved with them equally. I&rsquo;m just overwhelmed by the feats of people who invented such devices.</p>
<p>By the way, the development of technology makes us feel sick sometimes. SNS or videos, I don&rsquo;t want to be bothered by such things, but sometimes they are annoying. I feel like I&rsquo;m always observed by surveillance cameras and there is no escape from them. Some people commit suicide feeling pessimistic about their lives. But Nothing lasts forever. Everyone gets old and die one after another. If the orbit of the earth rotating around the sun changes and the earth plunge into the sun, everything on the earth will be destroyed and nothing will remain. Or if the earth go outside of its current orbit and move to the places like Mars or Jupiter, Life on earth will be extinct. There seems no life on Mars. Life may have been extinct on Mars. I think life have many forms adapting to each environment of the planet. The earth is like a galapagos island in the universe. If life on the earth has been extinct and the next form of life discovers the remains of us, they will try to understand us like we try to understand other species of animals, but it&rsquo;ll not be fun for them. Lives of people of other countries are difficult to understand. It&rsquo;s hard to understand what&rsquo;s funny in their culture. Even scenes that are considered obscene or nasty aren&rsquo;t so interesting. Those are stories of people who have no connection with me, then they are not so interesting at all.</p>
<p>I wonder what I&rsquo;m doing in this world being buffeted by the time and the people. I think I&rsquo;m just leading a life destined by astrology. People with great fortune shines brightly while people with ordinally fortune gleam dim. I&rsquo;m just one of fans of big stars being fascinated or excited or mesmerized by their beauty or their heroic acts. The attractive forces and repelling forces of the stars destines our fate. They sometimes strengthen with each others but sometimes weaken each others. The important thing is to choose the people with good destiny in our life. Everyone has the initial vectors of velocities of movements on the surface of the earth. I&rsquo;ve heard that the destiny is determined by the location and time of our birth. Such things determine our life.  Even if you are destined to live as a small star initially, you can choose the best partner to strengthen your destiny. I&rsquo;ve heard that such analyses are derived from the statistics. The lives of countless people from the ancient era. In the past, people had leisure to collect such statistics. Nowadays we have computer power to analyze big data, maybe we can make better ways to live in our societies. But this is not a scientific approach I guess. The important things aren&rsquo;t measurable like molecules. The great scientists measured things with approximate values. Quantities of molecules or liquid or gas, trying to measure the approximate figure of the things using such approximate values with some precision, such acts are scientific attitudes. The size and scale of  the measure. A sieve to extract or a net to capture the object. Now I&rsquo;m sleepy so these thoughts are pointless. I need to earn money, daily living. I need to sleep tonight.</p>
